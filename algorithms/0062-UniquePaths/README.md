### 题目
A robot is located at the top-left corner of a m x n grid (marked 'Start' in the diagram below).<br>
The robot can only move either down or right at any point in time. The robot is trying to reach the bottom-right corner of the grid (marked 'Finish' in the diagram below).<br>
How many possible unique paths are there?

#### example1
```
Input: m = 3, n = 2
Output: 3
Explanation:
From the top-left corner, there are a total of 3 ways to reach the bottom-right corner:
1. Right -> Right -> Down
2. Right -> Down -> Right
3. Down -> Right -> Right
```

### 大意
已知一个m*n的表格，求从左上角到右下角共有多少条路径。

### 思路
动态规划
